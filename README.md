# Markov Chain Game Project

This school project involves creating a game based on Markov chains, in both C and Python \[Bachelor level\]. The project is divided into several branches, each serving a specific purpose. Here's an overview of the main branches and their functionalities:

## Branch A

Branch A represents the first part of the project. In this part, we define objects in the C language. This part can serve as a foundation for the subsequent steps of the project.

## Branch B

Branch B completes Part A of the project. It allows for a functional game that can be executed in a terminal. The game's rules will be defined in more detail below.

## Branch C

Branch C represents the rewriting of Part B in the Python language. This step makes the game more accessible, with a graphic interface, to a broader audience by using a popular programming language like Python.

## Branch Maths

Branch Maths represents a mathematical modeling of the Markov Chains.

## Rules

- There are a total of 20 cards, each with its own unique power.
- Turns alternate between the two players.
- Each player has 5 characters.
- The game board consists of 10 spaces, where character movement follows a Markov chain.
- The turn order is as follows:
    1. The player uses a card or spends money to increase the probabilities of moving from one space to another, or takes no action.
    2. Characters move according to the Markov chain.
    3. Monsters move according to the Markov chain and may eat characters on the same space.
- The game continues until one player has no more characters.

**Have fun!**
