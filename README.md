# Markov Chain Game Project

This school project involves creating a game based on Markov chains, in both C and Python \[Bachelor level\]. The project is divided into several branches, each serving a specific purpose. Here's an overview of the main branches and their functionalities:

## Branch A

Branch A represents the first part of the project. In this part, we define objects in the C language. This part can serve as a foundation for the subsequent steps of the project.

## Branch B

Branch B completes Part A of the project. It allows for a functional game that can be executed in a terminal. The game's rules will be defined in more detail below.

## Branch C

Branch C represents the rewriting of Part B in the Python language. This step makes the game more accessible, with a graphic interface, to a broader audience by using a popular programming language like Python.
